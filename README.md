I developed an Employee Payroll Management System using Java, Servlets, HTML, JavaScript, and MySQL. The main objective of this project is to manage employee details and their payroll information using CRUD operations.

In the Servlets, I implemented all the core functionalities such as adding an employee, viewing employee details, updating records, and deleting employee information. For the frontend, I created pages like index.html, addemployee.html, viewemployee.jsp, updateemployee.html, and deleteemployee.html to make the application user-friendly.

To structure the project properly, I used a Model (DAO) layer to handle database operations and a Controller (EmployeeServlet) to connect the frontend with the backend logic. The database was created using MySQL, and all operations—insert, update, retrieve, and delete—were performed from the DAO.

Overall, this project demonstrates how CRUD operations can be used to build a real-time web-based payroll system with proper layers like Model, View, and Controller for better structure and maintainability.
